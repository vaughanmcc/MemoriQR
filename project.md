## Workflows

### 1. Online Purchase Flow (New Order)

**Customer Journey:**
1. Customer visits memoriqr.co.nz
2. Selects hosting duration (5/10/25 years)
3. Selects product type (NFC/QR/Both)
4. Adds engraving text (if QR plate selected)
5. Completes checkout via Stripe

**Automation Flow:**
1. Payment success → Stripe webhook to Pipedream
2. Pipedream creates entry in Supabase:
   - `customers` table (if new customer)
   - `orders` table (order details)
   - `memorial_records` table (pre-create record, is_published=false)
   - Sets `hosting_duration`, `product_type`, `base_price`
   - Calculates `hosting_expires_at` = order_date + hosting_duration
3. Generate unique activation code and memorial slug
4. **IF product_type includes QR plate** (qr_only or both):
   - Create `supplier_orders` entry for Metal Image NZ
   - Send automated email to Metal Image NZ with:
     - Order number
     - Engraving text
     - QR code image (generated via API, points to memorial URL)
     - Shipping address
5. **IF product_type is nfc_only:**
   - Skip Metal Image NZ order
   - Mark for immediate NFC programming and shipping
6. Send confirmation email to customer via SendGrid:
   - Order details
   - Upload link with activation code
   - What happens next
   - Timeline (2-3 days for NFC, 7-10 days for plates)

### 2. Content Upload & Memorial Activation

**Customer uploads content:**
1. Customer clicks link in email → lands on WordPress upload page
2. Enters activation code (validates against `memorial_records`)
3. Fills in memorial details:
   - Deceased name, dates, story/text
   - Upload photos (max based on tier: 20/40/60)
   - Upload videos (max based on tier: 2/3/5) OR provide YouTube links

**Automation:**
1. Form submission → Pipedream webhook
2. Photos uploaded to Cloudinary:
   - Auto-compress to WebP
   - Generate thumbnails
   - Return Cloudinary URLs
3. Videos uploaded to YouTube (customer's account or MemoriQR channel):
   - Set to "unlisted" for privacy
   - Generate embed codes
4. Pipedream updates `memorial_records` in Supabase:
   - Populate `photos_json` and `videos_json`
   - Update `photo_count` and `video_count`
   - Verify counts don't exceed `photo_limit` and `video_limit`
   - Save `memorial_text`
   - Set `is_published = true` (makes memorial live)
5. Memorial page generated at: memoriqr.co.nz/memorial/[slug]
6. Send confirmation email with memorial URL

### 3. Physical Product Fulfillment

**For QR Plates:**
1. Metal Image NZ receives order email
2. Produces engraved plate (5-7 days)
3. Ships to MemoriQR or directly to customer
4. MemoriQR receives tracking number → updates `orders.tracking_number`
5. Customer receives shipping notification via SendGrid

**For NFC Tags:**
1. Program NFC tag with memorial URL using NFC Tools app
2. Attach to backing card with instructions
3. Package and ship via NZ Post
4. Generate tracking → update database

**For Both:**
1. Wait for QR plate from Metal Image NZ
2. Program NFC tag
3. Package both together
4. Ship with combined instructions

### 4. Retail Partner Flow

**Setup:**
1. Partner (vet/crematorium) signs up via partner portal
2. MemoriQR creates `partners` entry in Supabase
3. Generate batch of activation codes:
   - Insert 50-100 codes into `retail_activation_codes`
   - Link to `partner_id`
   - Print codes on physical tags or cards
4. Ship pre-made tags to partner with instructions

**Customer Activation:**
1. Customer receives tag from partner (e.g., with pet's ashes)
2. Scans QR code → redirects to memoriqr.co.nz/activate?code=XXXXX
3. Enter activation code on WordPress activation page
4. Supabase validates code:
   - Check `retail_activation_codes.is_used = false`
   - Check code hasn't expired
5. If valid, proceed to upload flow (same as online purchase #2)
6. Mark code as used: `is_used = true`, `used_at = NOW()`
7. Create `memorial_records` entry with partner attribution
8. Partner earns commission (tracked for monthly payout)

### 5. Renewal Flow

**Automated Renewal Reminders:**
1. **Pipedream scheduled trigger** runs daily at 9am NZST
2. Query Supabase for memorials where:
   - `days_until_expiry IN (30, 7, 1)`
   - `renewal_status = 'active'`
3. For each memorial, send personalized email via SendGrid:
   - **30 days:** Friendly reminder with renewal link
   - **7 days:** Urgent reminder with consequences of expiry
   - **1 day:** Final notice with same-day renewal option
4. Email includes Stripe payment link:
   - 1 year renewal: $24
   - 5 year bulk: $99
   - 10 year bulk: $199
5. Log in `activity_log`: renewal_reminder sent

**Payment & Extension:**
1. Customer clicks renewal link → Stripe checkout
2. Payment success → Stripe webhook to Pipedream
3. Pipedream identifies memorial from payment metadata
4. Update Supabase `memorial_records`:
   - `hosting_expires_at` += renewal duration (1/5/10 years)
   - `renewal_status = 'renewed'`
   - `updated_at = NOW()`
5. Send confirmation email: "Your memorial is renewed until [new date]"
6. Log in `activity_log`: renewal completed

**Grace Period (No Payment):**
1. **Day 0** (expiry date): Memorial still live but shows banner:
   - "Hosting expired on [date]. Renew now to keep your memorial online."
2. **Days 1-30:** Banner remains, memorial accessible
3. **Day 30 post-expiry:**
   - Set `is_published = false` (memorial goes offline)
   - Redirect memorial URL to: "This memorial's hosting has expired. Renew to restore."
4. Send "final warning" email:
   - Memorial is now offline
   - Can still renew within 90 days
   - After 90 days, content will be archived
5. **Day 121 (90 days post-expiry):**
   - Archive memorial data to cold storage (optional)
   - Send final email with data export link (photos/videos zip)
   - Customer has 30 days to download

### 6. Memorial Page Views (Analytics)

**Every page view:**
1. JavaScript on memorial page triggers on load
2. Fetch request to Pipedream webhook with:
   - Memorial ID
   - Timestamp
   - IP address (anonymized)
   - User agent
3. Pipedream updates Supabase:
   - Increment `memorial_records.views_count`
   - Update `last_viewed`
   - Insert record in `activity_log` (type: 'viewed')
4. Optional: Generate weekly/monthly analytics reports for customer

---

## Important Business Rules

1. **Memorial URLs are permanent:** Once a slug is assigned (memoriqr.co.nz/memorial/fluffy-2024), it never changes, even if content is updated

2. **Orders with QR plates** (qr_only or both) trigger automatic email to Metal Image NZ with QR code specifications. NFC-only orders skip this step

3. **Hosting expiry grace period:** 30 days after hosting expires, memorial remains accessible with renewal banner. After 30 days, goes offline but can be restored within 90 days

4. **Retail activation codes** can only be used once. If a customer tries to reuse a code, show error and provide support contact

5. **Video hosting privacy:** All videos uploaded to YouTube must be set to "unlisted" (not private, not public). Unlisted means only people with the link can view, which is appropriate for memorial pages

6. **Hosting expiry reminders** sent at 30 days, 7 days, and 1 day before expiry via automated Pipedream workflow

7. **Grace period** of 30 days after hosting expires before memorial goes offline, then 90-day data export window

8. **NFC-only orders** ship immediately (2-3 days) as no engraving wait time required

9. **Renewal pricing locked** at $24/year regardless of inflation, since customer acquisition cost already paid upfront

10. **Content moderation:** All memorials reviewed within 24 hours of publishing. Inappropriate content flagged for manual review

11. **Media limits enforced:** Upload forms validate photo/video counts against tier limits (20/40/60 photos, 2/3/5 videos). Customers can purchase add-ons after initial upload.

12. **Video privacy:** All uploaded videos (non-YouTube) are hosted as unlisted. YouTube-linked videos must be set to unlisted by customer.

## Cost Analysis

### Assumptions
- Average memorial based on tier mix (30% 5yr, 50% 10yr, 20% 25yr)
- Average photos: ~35 photos per memorial (weighted average)
- Photo size after WebP compression: 1.5MB each
- Average storage per memorial: ~52MB
- Videos hosted on YouTube = $0 storage/bandwidth
- Average views: 100 visits/year
- Bandwidth per visit: Photos only (videos via YouTube)
- Total bandwidth per memorial per year: ~5.2GB

### Hosting Costs by Scale

**Year 1 (100 memorials):**
- Storage: 5.2GB (photos only, videos on YouTube)
- Bandwidth: 520GB/year (~43GB/month)
- Hostinger Business: $3/month (includes unlimited bandwidth)
- Cloudinary: Free tier (25GB storage, 25 credits) - need upgrade
- Cloudinary Plus: $89/month (225GB storage, 225 credits)
- Supabase: Free tier (500MB database)
- **Total: ~$90-95/month**

**Year 2 (500 memorials):**
- Storage: 26GB
- Bandwidth: 2.6TB/year (~217GB/month)
- Hostinger Business: $3/month
- Cloudinary Plus: $89/month (sufficient)
- Supabase: Pro $25/month (database >500MB)
- Pipedream: Core $9/month (>10k ops/month)
- SendGrid: Free tier (300 emails/day)
- **Total: ~$125-130/month**

**Year 3 (2000 memorials):**
- Storage: 104GB
- Bandwidth: 10.4TB/year (~867GB/month)
- Hostinger Business: $3/month (still unlimited bandwidth)
- Cloudinary Plus: $89/month (225GB sufficient)
- Supabase: Pro $25/month
- Pipedream: Core $9/month
- SendGrid: Essentials $15/month (if >300 emails/day)
- **Total: ~$140-145/month**

### Key Cost Drivers

**Bandwidth:** Mitigated by YouTube video hosting ($0) and Hostinger's unlimited bandwidth. With media limits, bandwidth is predictable and manageable.
**Storage:** Cloudinary Plus tier ($89/month) covers up to 2000+ memorials with photo limits enforced.
**Database:** Supabase free tier sufficient until ~500 memorials, then Pro $25/month.
**Email:** SendGrid free tier covers ~10 emails/day; upgrade to Essentials at scale.
**Media limits:** Critical cost control - without limits, storage could exceed 300GB requiring Advanced tier ($224/month).

### Transaction Costs

**Stripe fees:** 2.9% + $0.30 NZD per transaction
- Average order $200: Fee = $6.10
- Net revenue: $193.90

**No currency conversion:** Stripe supports NZD and AUD directly, avoiding 1% conversion fees

---

## Break-Even Analysis

### Revenue Model Assumptions
- Average order value: $220 (mix of 5/10/25 year tiers, mix of NFC/QR/Both)
- Product mix: 30% NFC-only, 40% QR-only, 30% Both
- Renewal rate: 70% (30% churn after initial period)

### Variable Costs per Memorial
- NFC tag: $7
- QR plate: $45 (when applicable)
- Shipping: $10
- Platform fees (Stripe): ~$6
- Storage/bandwidth (amortized): $1-2/year
- **Average variable cost: $45-65 depending on product type**

### Fixed Costs
- Hosting/tools: $50-140/month (scales with volume)
- Domain: $10/year
- Business registration: $50/year
- Marketing: $500-1000/month (variable, treat as semi-fixed)

### Break-Even Calculation

**Year 1 (targeting 100 memorials):**
- Revenue: 100 × $220 = $22,000
- Variable costs: 100 × $55 (avg) = $5,500
- Fixed costs: $90/month × 12 = $1,080 hosting + $1,000 other = $2,080
- Gross profit: $22,000 - $5,500 - $2,080 = **$14,420**
- **Break-even: ~35 memorials**

**Year 2 (targeting 500 memorials):**
- New memorials: 400 (cumulative 500)
- Renewals: 70 × $24 = $1,680
- Revenue: 400 × $220 + $1,680 = $89,680
- Variable costs: 400 × $55 = $22,000
- Fixed costs: $125/month × 12 = $1,500 + $1,000 = $2,500
- Gross profit: $89,680 - $22,000 - $2,500 = **$65,180**

**Year 3 (targeting 2000 cumulative):**
- New memorials: 1500
- Renewals: ~350 × $24 = $8,400 (assumes 70% renewal from Year 1-2)
- Revenue: 1500 × $220 + $8,400 = $338,400
- Variable costs: 1500 × $55 = $82,500
- Fixed costs: $145/month × 12 = $1,740 + $1,000 = $2,740
- Gross profit: $338,400 - $82,500 - $2,740 = **$253,160**

### Profitability Timeline
- **Month 3-4:** Break-even (35-40 orders)
- **Month 12:** $14k+ profit (100 orders)
- **Year 2:** $65k+ profit (500 cumulative)
- **Year 3:** $253k+ profit (2000 cumulative)

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks

**1. Bandwidth Spikes**
- **Risk:** If video views exceed assumptions or customers upload 4K videos
- **Impact:** Could add $50-100/month in overages
- **Mitigation:** YouTube for ALL videos (unlimited free bandwidth), enforce file size limits

**2. Storage Abuse**
- **Risk:** Customers upload maximum allowed photos repeatedly or use large file sizes
- **Impact:** Storage costs increase faster than projected
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Enforce hard limits: 20/40/60 photos max by tier, 2/3/5 videos max
  - Max file size: 10MB per photo, 100MB per video
  - Automatic compression via Cloudinary (WebP format reduces size 25-35%)
  - Form validation prevents oversized uploads
  - Add-on pricing for extra capacity ($10/20 photos) discourages abuse

**3. Platform Outages**
- **Risk:** Hostinger, Supabase, or YouTube downtime
- **Impact:** Memorials inaccessible during grief period
- **Mitigation:**
  - Choose providers with 99.9%+ uptime SLAs
  - Monitor with UptimeRobot (free)
  - Display status page during outages

**4. Security Breaches**
- **Risk:** WordPress hacks, database leaks
- **Impact:** Customer data exposed, GDPR violations
- **Mitigation:**
  - WordPress security plugins (Wordfence free tier)
  - Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies
  - Regular backups (daily via Hostinger)
  - SSL certificates (free via Let's Encrypt)

### Business Risks

**5. Renewal Churn**
- **Risk:** 30-40% of customers don't renew after initial period
- **Impact:** Lost recurring revenue
- **Mitigation:**
  - Emotional reminder emails: "Keep [pet name]'s memory alive"
  - Offer bulk renewals at discount (10 years for $99)
  - Grace period encourages late renewals

**6. Competitor Pricing**
- **Risk:** $99 USD (~$160 NZD) lifetime competitors
- **Impact:** Price-sensitive customers choose them
- **Mitigation:**
  - Emphasize local NZ service, faster delivery
  - Superior materials (316 stainless vs unknown)
  - NFC option (competitors don't offer)
  - Better support and understanding of NZ/Māori culture

**7. Retail Partner Friction**
- **Risk:** Vets/crematoriums don't want to sell tags
- **Impact:** B2B2C channel fails
- **Mitigation:**
  - 20% commission (strong incentive)
  - Zero effort: pre-made tags, customer activates themselves
  - Co-marketing materials provided
  - Trial with 2-3 partners before scaling

**8. Supplier Dependency**
- **Risk:** Metal Image NZ goes out of business or raises prices
- **Impact:** Can't fulfill QR plate orders
- **Mitigation:**
  - Identify backup supplier (LaserMaster NZ, GraphicGuru)
  - Negotiate annual price lock
  - Keep 20-30 blank plates in stock for emergencies

### Financial Risks

**9. Unsustainable Lifetime Hosting**
- **Risk:** If offering "true lifetime," costs accumulate indefinitely
- **Impact:** Unprofitable after 1500+ memorials
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use "prepaid hosting" (5/10/25 years) instead of "lifetime"
  - Clearly state hosting duration in terms
  - Renewal model ensures ongoing revenue

**10. Cash Flow Gaps**
- **Risk:** Upfront costs (inventory, marketing) before revenue
- **Impact:** Can't fulfill orders
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with 50 orders (minimal inventory)
  - Pre-orders before bulk inventory purchase
  - Line of credit or personal savings buffer ($5k)

### Scaling Risks

**11. Customer Support Overwhelm**
- **Risk:** At 500+ customers, support requests exceed capacity
- **Impact:** Poor reviews, churn
- **Mitigation:**
  - Comprehensive FAQ page
  - Video tutorials for upload process
  - Hire part-time VA at 500+ memorials
  - Ticketing system (Freshdesk free tier)

**12. Manufacturing Bottlenecks**
- **Risk:** Metal Image NZ can't keep up with 50+ orders/month
- **Impact:** Delivery delays, angry customers
- **Mitigation:**
  - Communicate lead times clearly (7-10 days)
  - Order batching: weekly batch to Metal Image
  - Identify second supplier as backup
