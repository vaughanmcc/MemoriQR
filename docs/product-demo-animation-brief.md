# Project Title: 15-30 second mobile product demo animation for memorial QR tag company

## About the Product
MemoriQR sells premium memorial tags with embedded NFC chips and QR codes. When someone taps their phone on the tag (or scans the QR code), it opens a beautiful online memorial page with photos, videos, and a written tribute to their loved one.

The tags are attached to urns, headstones, keepsake boxes, or displayed in homes.

## What I Need
A short (15-30 second) animation showing:

1.  **Scene 1:** A hand holding a smartphone approaches a memorial tag (can be shown on an urn, photo frame, or simple surface)
2.  **Scene 2:** Phone taps the tag OR camera scans the QR code - subtle "connection" effect
3.  **Scene 3:** Brief scroll through the memorial page showing photo, name, dates, tribute text
5.  **End:** Fade to logo + tagline: "MemoriQR - Keep Their Memory Alive"

## Tone & Style
*   Warm, respectful, gentle - this is about remembering loved ones, not a tech product
*   Soft, muted colours (creams, soft blues, gentle greens)
*   Slow, smooth transitions - nothing flashy or corporate
*   Optional: soft piano or ambient music (royalty-free)

## Assets Provided
*   MemoriQR logo
*   Product photos of a memorial QR tag attached to a headstone

## Deliverables
*   MP4 video (1080p minimum, 4K preferred)
*   Square version (1:1) for social media
*   Looping version without end card (for website autoplay)
